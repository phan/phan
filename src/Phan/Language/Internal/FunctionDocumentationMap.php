Name expansion:
The function prepends and appends some special characters to the function name until it finds the function name,
then it returns the function address or NULL if the function was not found.
These special characters are the most common ones encountered in various types of libraries.

MyFunction
MyFunctionA
MyFunctionW
_MyFunction
_MyFunctionA
_MyFunctionW
MyFunction@0, MyFunction@4, MyFunction@8... until MyFunction@80
_MyFunction@0, _MyFunction@4, _MyFunction@8... until MyFunction@80
