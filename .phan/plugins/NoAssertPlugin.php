/**
 * This plugin checks for occurrences of `assert(cond)` for Phan's self-analysis.
 * It is not suitable for some projects.
 * See https://github.com/phan/phan/issues/288
 *
 * This file demonstrates plugins for Phan. Plugins hook into various events.
 * NoAssertPlugin hooks into one event:
 *
 * - getPostAnalyzeNodeVisitorClassName
 *   This method returns a visitor that is called on every AST node from every
 *   file being analyzed
 *
 * A plugin file must
 *
 * - Contain a class that inherits from \Phan\PluginV3
 *
 * - End by returning an instance of that class.
 *
 * It is assumed without being checked that plugins aren't
 * mangling state within the passed code base or context.
 *
 * Note: When adding new plugins,
 * add them to the corresponding section of README.md
