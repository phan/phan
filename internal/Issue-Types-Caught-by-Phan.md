# CompatError

This category of issue is emitted when there are compatibility issues. They will be thrown if there is an expression that may be treated differently in PHP7 than it was in previous major versions of the PHP runtime. Take a look at the [PHP7 Migration Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php) to understand changes in behavior.

## PhanCompatibleAnyReturnTypePHP56

```
In PHP 5.6, return types ({TYPE}) are not supported
```

## PhanCompatibleArrowFunction

```
Cannot use arrow functions before php 7.4 in {CODE}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/expected/032_variadic_promoted_property.php.expected#L11) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/src/032_variadic_promoted_property.php#L9).

## PhanCompatibleAssertDeclaration

```
Declaring a custom assert() function is a fatal error in PHP 8.0+ because the function has special semantics.
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/v4/tests/php80_files/expected/038_assert.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/v4/tests/php80_files/src/038_assert.php#L3).

## PhanCompatibleAttributeGroupOnMultipleLines

NOTE: This is done on a best effort basis - The native php-ast parser does not provide the actual end line numbers for attribute groups.

```
Declaring attributes across multiple lines may be treated like a mix of a line comment and php tokens before php 8.0 for attribute group {CODE} of {CODE} ending around line {LINE}. Note that php-ast does not provide the actual ending line numbers and this issue may be unreliable
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/expected/032_attributes_repeatable.php.expected#L4) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/src/032_attributes_repeatable.php#L11).

## PhanCompatibleAttributeGroupOnSameLine


```
Declaring attributes on the same line as a declaration is treated like a line comment before php 8.0 for attribute group {CODE} of {CODE}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/expected/033_attribute_line_compat.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/src/033_attribute_line_compat.php#L5).

## PhanCompatibleAutoload

```
Declaring an autoloader with function __autoload() was deprecated in PHP 7.2 and is a fatal error in PHP 8.0+. Use spl_autoload_register() instead (supported since PHP 5.1).
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/000_plugins.php.expected#L21) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/000_plugins.php#L64).

## PhanCompatibleConstructorPropertyPromotion

```
Cannot use constructor property promotion before php 8.0 for {PARAMETER} of {METHOD}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/expected/032_variadic_promoted_property.php.expected#L2) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/src/032_variadic_promoted_property.php#L3).

## PhanCompatibleDefaultEqualsNull

```
In PHP 8.0, using a default ({CODE}) that resolves to null will no longer cause the parameter ({PARAMETER}) to be nullable
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/expected/0782_nullable_compat.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/src/0782_nullable_compat.php#L4).

## PhanCompatibleDimAlternativeSyntax

This is emitted deliberately when using the polyfill and/or using php 7.4+.

```
Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated in PHP 7.4. Use square brackets instead. Seen for {CODE}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/misc/fallback_test/expected/062_test.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/misc/fallback_test/src/062_test.php#L2).

## PhanCompatibleExpressionPHP7

This issue will be thrown if there is an expression that may be treated differently in PHP7 than it was in previous major versions of the PHP runtime. Take a look at the [PHP7 Migration Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php) to understand changes in behavior.

The config `backward_compatibility_checks` must be enabled for this to run such as by passing the command line argument `--backward-compatibility-checks` or by defining it in a `.phan/config.php` file such as [Phan's own config](https://github.com/phan/phan/blob/2.4.1/.phan/config.php).

```
{CLASS} expression may not be PHP 7 compatible
```

## PhanCompatibleImplodeOrder

```
In php 7.4, passing glue string after the array is deprecated for {FUNCTION}. Should this swap the parameters of type {TYPE} and {TYPE}?
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/expected/0511_implode.php.expected#L3) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/src/0511_implode.php#L7).

## PhanCompatibleIterableTypePHP70

```
Return type '{TYPE}' means a Traversable/array value starting in PHP 7.1. In PHP 7.0, iterable refers to a class/interface with the name 'iterable'
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php70_files/expected/006_iterable.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php70_files/src/006_iterable.php#L3).

## PhanCompatibleKeyedArrayAssignPHP70

```
Using array keys in an array destructuring assignment is not compatible with PHP 7.0
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php70_files/expected/003_short_array.php.expected#L7) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php70_files/src/003_short_array.php#L21).

## PhanCompatibleMatchExpression

```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/expected/019_match.php.expected#L3) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/php80_files/src/019_match.php#L3).

## PhanCompatibleMixedType

```

This can also be suppressed on the functionlike's declaration.

```
Providing an unused optional parameter ${PARAMETER} to {FUNCTIONLIKE} defined at {FILE}:{LINE}
```

Possibly zero write references to PHPDoc @property {PROPERTY}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/108_magic_property_unreferenced.php.expected#L4) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/108_magic_property_unreferenced.php#L9).

## PhanReadOnlyPrivateProperty

for a given declared property, but no write operations on that property.

There may be false positives if dynamic property accesses are performed, or if the code is a library that is used elsewhere.

```
Possibly zero write references to private property {PROPERTY}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/084_read_only_property.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/084_read_only_property.php#L4).

## PhanSideEffectFreeDoWhileBody

**Note that `PhanSideEffectFree...` issue types rely on `--unused-variable-detection`, and will not run in the global scope as a result.**
Also note that the plugin `UseReturnValuePlugin` and its `plugin_config` setting `infer_pure_methods` should be enabled,
for this to warn about loops containing function and method calls.

```
Saw a do-while loop which probably has no side effects
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/172_infer_pure_useless_loop.php.expected#L3) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/172_infer_pure_useless_loop.php#L24).

```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/056_while_loop.php.expected#L2) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/056_while_loop.php#L4).

## PhanSuspiciousBinaryAddLists

```
Addition of {TYPE} + {TYPE} {CODE} is a suspicious way to add two lists. Some of the array fields from the left hand side will be part of the result, replacing the fields with the same key from the right hand side (this operator does not concatenate the lists)
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/expected/0838_globals_assign_op.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/src/0838_globals_assign_op.php#L4).

## PhanUnreferencedClass

Similar issues exist for PhanUnreferencedProperty, PhanUnreferencedConstant, PhanUnreferencedMethod, and PhanUnreferencedFunction

This issue is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `dead_code_detection` to enabled. It indicates that the given element is (possibly) unused.

```
Possibly zero references to class {CLASS}
```

This will be emitted for the following code so long as `dead_code_detection` is enabled.

```php
class C {}
```

Keep in mind that for the following code we'd still emit the issue.

```php
class C2 {}
$v = 'C2';
new $v;

$v2 = 'C' . (1 + 1);
new $v2;
```

YMMV.

to detect if a variable or parameter is unused.

```
Unused definition of variable ${VARIABLE}
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/misc/fallback_test/expected/037_assign_op.php.expected#L2) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/misc/fallback_test/src/037_assign_op.php#L3).

```


## PhanUseConstantNoEffect

NOTE: this deliberately warns only about use statements in the global namespace,
and not for `namespace MyNs; use function MyNs\PHP_VERSION_ID;`,
which does have an effect of preventing the fallback to the global constant.

```
The use statement for constant {CONST} has no effect
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/expected/0553_unreferenced_use.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/src/0553_unreferenced_use.php#L4).

## PhanUseFunctionNoEffect

NOTE: this deliberately warns only about use statements in the global namespace,
and not for `namespace MyNs; use function MyNs\is_string;`,
which does have an effect of preventing the fallback to the global function.

```
The use statement for function {FUNCTION} has no effect
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/expected/0553_unreferenced_use.php.expected#L3) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/files/src/0553_unreferenced_use.php#L6).

## PhanUseNormalNamespacedNoEffect

## PhanUselessBinaryAddRight

```
Addition of {TYPE} + {TYPE} {CODE} is probably unnecessary. Array fields from the left hand side will be used instead of each of the fields from the right hand side
```

## PhanParamNameIndicatingUnused

Note that this it may be appropriate to suppress this under the following circumstances:

1. The parameter's name in the public API is actually meant to be `$unused*` or `$_`
2. The project documents that it does not guarantee that parameter names won't change
   or that named arguments shouldn't be used with the functions it provides.
3. The functionality is marked as `@internal`

```
Saw a parameter named ${PARAMETER}. If this was used to indicate that a parameter is unused to Phan, consider using @unused-param after a param comment or suppressing unused parameter warnings instead. PHP 8.0 introduces support for named parameters, so changing names to suppress unused parameter warnings is no longer recommended.
```

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/181_provide_unused_param.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/181_provide_unused_param.php#L2).

## PhanParamNameIndicatingUnusedInClosure

## PhanParamSignatureMismatch

This compares the param and return types inferred from phpdoc and real types,
and warns if an overriding method's signature is incompatible with the overridden method.
**For a check with much lower false positives and clearer issue messages, use the `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatch...` issue types instead.**

```
Declaration of {METHOD} should be compatible with {METHOD} defined in {FILE}:{LINE}{DETAILS}

## PhanTypeMismatchArgumentReal

This is a more severe version of `PhanTypeMismatchArgument` for code that Phan infers is likely to throw an Error at runtime.
This ignores some configuration settings allowing nulls to cast to other types, etc.
It is emitted instead of `PhanTypeMismatchArgument` under the following conditions:

- Phan infers real types for both the argument expression and the parameter's real signature.
- The union type of the argument doesn't have any types that are partially compatible with the return type from the signature.
- If `strict_types` isn't enabled in the caller, it won't be emitted if the returned expression could be a non-null scalar and the declared return type has any scalars.

This does not attempt to account for the possibility of overriding methods being more permissive about what argument types are accepted.

```
Argument {INDEX} (${PARAMETER}) is {CODE} of type {TYPE}{DETAILS} but {FUNCTIONLIKE} takes {TYPE}{DETAILS} defined at {FILE}:{LINE}

## PhanTypeMismatchReturnReal

This is a more severe version of `PhanTypeMismatchReturn` for code that Phan infers is likely to throw an Error at runtime.
This ignores some configuration settings allowing nulls to cast to other types, etc.
It is emitted instead of `PhanTypeMismatchReturn` under the following conditions:

- Phan infers real types for both the returned expression and the function's signature
- The union type of the returned expression doesn't have any types that are partially compatible with the return type from the signature.
- If `strict_types` isn't enabled, it won't be emitted if the returned expression could be a non-null scalar and the declared return type has any scalars.

```
Returning {CODE} of type {TYPE}{DETAILS} but {FUNCTIONLIKE} is declared to return {TYPE}{DETAILS}
```

This issue is emitted from the following code

```php
class G { function f() : int { return 'string'; } }
```

# UndefError

This category of issue comes up when there are references to undefined things. These are a big source of false-positives in Phan given that code bases often take liberties with calling methods on sub-classes of the class defined to be returned by a function and things like that.

You can ignore all errors of this category by passing in the command-line argument `-i` or `--ignore-undeclared`.

## PhanSyntaxError

This emits warnings for unparsable PHP files (detected by `php-ast`).
Note: This is not the same thing as running `php -l` on a file - PhanSyntaxError checks for syntax errors, but not semantics such as where certain expressions can occur (Which `php -l` would check for).

Note: If the native parser is used, the reported column is a guess. Phan will use the column of the error reported by the **polyfill** if the errors are on the same line.

e.g. [this issue](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/expected/136_unexpected_bracket.php.expected#L1) is emitted when analyzing [this PHP file](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/4.0.0/tests/plugin_test/src/136_unexpected_bracket.php#L2).
