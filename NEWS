?? ??? 2017, Phan 0.9.2 (dev)
-----------------------

New Features (Analysis)
+ Add `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatch`, which ignores phpdoc types and imitates PHP's inheritance warning/error checks as closely as possible. (Issue #374)
  This has a much lower rate of false positives than `PhanParamSignatureMismatch`, which is based on Liskov Substitution Principle and also accounts for phpdoc types.
  (`PhanParamSignatureMismatch` continues to exist)
+ Create `PhanUndeclaredStaticProperty` (Issue #610)
  This is of higher severity than PhanUndeclaredProperty, because PHP 7 throws an Error.
  Also add `PhanAccessPropertyStaticAsNonStatic`
+ Supports magic instance/static `@method` annotations. (Issue #467)
  This is enabled by default.
+ Support for checking for misuses of "@internal" annotations. Phan assumes this means it is internal to a namespace. (Issue #353)
  This checks properties, methods, class constants, and classes.
  (Adds `PhanAccessConstantInternal`, `PhanAccessClassInternal`, `PhanAccessClassConstantInternal`, `PhanAccessPropertyInternal`, `PhanAccessMethodInternal`)
  (The implementation may change)
+ Make conditionals such as `is_string` start applying to the condition in ternary operators (`$a ? $b : $c`)

New Features (CLI, Configs)
+ Add `--color` CLI flag, with rudimentary unix terminal coloring for the plain text output formatter. (Issue #363)
  Color schemes are customizable with `color_scheme`, in the config file.
+ Add a config to excludes file paths from a regular expression (e.g. tests or example files mixed with the codebase) (#635)

Maintenance
+ Update function signature map to analyze `iterable` and `is_iterable` from php 7.1
+ Improve type inferences on functions with nullable default values.
+ Update miscellaneous new functions in php 7.1 standard library (e.g. `getenv`)

Bug Fixes
- Fix PhanTypeMismatchArgument, etc. for uses of `new static()`, static::CONST, etc in a method. (Issue #632)
- Fix uncaught exception when conditional node is a scalar (Issue #613)
- Existence of __get() no longer affects analyzing static properties. (Issue #610)

0.9.1 Mar 15, 2017
------------------

New Features (Analysis)
+ Conditions in `if(cond(A) && expr(A))` (e.g. `instanceof`, `is_string`, etc) now affect analysis of right hand side of `&&` (PR #540)
+ Add `PhanDeprecatedInterface` and `PhanDeprecatedTrait`, similar to `PhanDeprecatedClass`
+ Supports magic `@property` annotations, with aliases `@property-read` and @property-write`. (Issue #386)
  This is enabled by default.
  Also adds `@phan-forbid-undeclared-magic-properties` annotation,
  which will make Phan warn about undeclared properties if no real property or `@property` annotation exists.

New Features (CLI, Configs)
+ Add `--version` CLI flag
+ Move some rare CLI options from `--help` into `--extended-help`

Maintenance
+ Improved stability of analyzing phpdoc and real nullable types (Issue #567)
+ Fix type signatures Phan has for some internal methods.
+ Improve CLI `--progress-bar` tracking by printing 0% immediately.
+ Add Developer Certificate of Origin

Bug Fixes
+ Fix uncaught issue exception analyzing class constants (Issue #551)
+ Fix group use in ASTs
+ Fix false positives checking if native types can cast to/from nullable native types (Issue #567, #582)
+ Exit with non-zero exit code if an invalid CLI argument is passed to Phan

Backwards Incompatible Changes
+ Change the way that parameter's default values affect type inferences.
  (May now add to the union type or ignore default values. Used to always add the default value types)
  Add `@param` types if you encounter new issues.
  This was done to avoid false positives in cases such as `function foo($maybeArray = false)`
+ Increase minimum `ext-ast` version constraint to 0.1.4

0.9.0 Feb 21, 2017
------------------

The 0.9.x versions will be tracking syntax from PHP versions 7.1.x and is runnable on PHP 7.1+.
Please use version 0.8.x if you're using a version of PHP < 7.1.

New Features (Analysis)
+ Support php 7.1 class constant visibility
+ Support variadic phpdoc in `@param`, e.g. `@param string ...$args`
  Avoid ambiguity by emitting `PhanTypeMismatchVariadicComment` and `PhanTypeMismatchVariadicParam`.
+ Initial support for php 7.1 nullable types and void, both in phpdoc and real parameters.
+ Initial support for php 7.1 `iterable` type
+ Both conditions from `if(cond(A) && cond(B))` (e.g. `instanceof`, `is_string`, etc.) now affect analysis of the if element's block (PR #540)
+ Apply conditionals such as `is_string` to type guards in ternary operators (Issue #465)
+ Allow certain checks for removing null from Phan's inferred types, reducing false positives (E.g. `if(!is_null($x) && $x->method())`) (#518)
+ Incomplete support for specifying the class scope in which a closure will be used/bound  (#309)
+ Support `@return self` in class context

New Features (CLI, Configs)
+ Introduce `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match` config (slow, disabled by default)
  (Checks if the phpdoc types match up with declared return types)

Maintenance
+ Add Code of Conduct
+ Fix type signatures for some internal methods and internal class properties.

Bug Fixes
+ Allow asserting `object` is a specific object type without warning (Issue #516)
+ Fix bugs in analysis of varargs within a function(Issue #516)
+ Treat null defaults in functions and methods the same way (Issue #508)
  In both, add null defaults to the UnionType only if there's already another type.
  In both, add non-null defaults to the UnionType (Contains `mixed` if there weren't any explicit types)
+ Specially handle phpdoc type aliases such as `boolean` only in phpdoc (Issue #471)
  (Outside of phpdoc, it refers to a class with the name `boolean`)
+ Add some internal classes other than `stdClass` which are allowed to have dynamic, undeclared properties (Issue #433)
+ Fix assertion errors when passing references by reference (Issue #500)

Backwards Incompatible Changes
+ Requires newer `ext-ast` version (Must support version 35).

0.8.3 Jan 26, 2017
------------------

The 0.8.x versions will be tracking syntax from PHP versions 7.0.x and is runnable on PHP 7.0+.
Please use version 0.8.x if you're using a version of PHP < 7.1.
For best results, run version 0.8.x with PHP 7.0 if you are analyzing a codebase which normally runs on php <= 7.0 
(If php 7.1 is used, Phan will think that some new classes, methods, and functions exist or have different parameter lists because it gets this info from `Reflection`)
