%s:3 PhanPluginUseReturnValueNoopVoid The function/method \Base9::test() is declared to return mixed and it has no side effects

%s:25 PhanParamSignatureRealMismatchReturnType Declaration of function test() should be compatible with function test() : mixed (method where the return type in the real signature is '' cannot override method where the return type in the real signature is 'mixed') defined in %s:9
%s:25 PhanPluginUnknownMethodReturnType Method \Other9B::test() has no declared or inferred return type (Types inferred after analysis: string)
%s:29 PhanParamSignatureMismatch Declaration of function mixedParam(int $a) should be compatible with function mixedParam(mixed $a) : ?mixed defined in %s:19 (Cannot use int $a with a real type to override parameter mixed $a without a real type)
%s:29 PhanParamSignatureRealMismatchHasParamType Declaration of function mixedParam(int $a) should be compatible with function mixedParam(mixed $a) (parameter #1 has type 'int' in the real signature which cannot replace original parameter with no type in the real signature) defined in %s:19
%s:29 PhanPluginUnknownMethodReturnType Method \Other9B::mixedParam() has no declared or inferred return type (Types inferred after analysis: int)
