%s:3 PhanCompatibleSerializeInterfaceDeprecated The Serializable interface is deprecated in php 8.1. If you need to retain the Serializable interface for cross-version compatibility, you can suppress this warning for \C by implementing __serialize() and __unserialize() in addition, which will take precedence over Serializable in PHP versions that support them. If you cannot avoid using Serializable and don't need to support php 8.1 or can tolerate deprecation notices, this issue should be suppressed
%s:8 PhanParamSignatureRealMismatchHasNoParamTypeInternal Declaration of function unserialize($serialized) should be compatible with internal function unserialize(string $data) (parameter #1 with no type in the real signature cannot replace original parameter with type 'string' in the real signature)
