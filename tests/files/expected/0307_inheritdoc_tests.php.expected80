%s:14 PhanCompatibleSerializeInterfaceDeprecated The Serializable interface is deprecated in php 8.1. If you need to retain the Serializable interface for cross-version compatibility, you can suppress this warning for \B307 by implementing __serialize() and __unserialize() in addition, which will take precedence over Serializable in PHP versions that support them. If you cannot avoid using Serializable and don't need to support php 8.1 or can tolerate deprecation notices, this issue should be suppressed
%s:18 PhanTypeMissingReturn Method \B307::offsetExists is declared to return bool in phpdoc but has no return value
%s:22 PhanTypeMissingReturn Method \B307::offsetGet is declared to return mixed in phpdoc but has no return value
%s:34 PhanTypeMismatchReturn Returning 42 of type 42 but serialize() is declared to return ?string
%s:38 PhanParamSignatureRealMismatchHasNoParamTypeInternal Declaration of function unserialize($serialized) should be compatible with internal function unserialize(string $data) (parameter #1 with no type in the real signature cannot replace original parameter with type 'string' in the real signature)
%s:39 PhanUnusedVariable Unused definition of variable $x
%s:44 PhanUnusedVariable Unused definition of variable $result
%s:51 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($offset) is null of type null but \B307::offsetExists() takes string (no real type) defined at %s:18 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:52 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($offset) is null of type null but \B307::offsetGet() takes string (no real type) defined at %s:22 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:53 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($offset) is null of type null but \B307::offsetSet() takes string (no real type) defined at %s:26 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
%s:54 PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal Argument 1 ($offset) is null of type null but \B307::offsetUnset() takes string (no real type) defined at %s:30 (the inferred real argument type has nothing in common with the parameter's phpdoc type)
